                This site is designeded primarily for personal and family use, and likely to be of little interest to others.  Since you're here, 
	            however, feel free to look around if you care to.  Most areas, with the exception of "Family" should be open to anyone.

				Among it's more customary uses, this site is my experimental playground.  As such, it should be considered to be always "Under Construction" and subject to outage, inexplicable change, odd behavior, visual irregularities, poor design, and whatever else I might do to screw it up.
				<br><br>
				In such an event, don't bother attempting to contact me.  I already know and will fix things as soon as I get the time and/or inclination.
