                This is my personal website and likely of little interest to the general public. Be that as it may, you're welcome to look around if you wish and I hope you find something of interest to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                At least for the time being, I've dual-purposed this website to serve not only as my personal site but also as a home for a small web and software development business I've started as a precursor to retirement which should be happening in a few hopefully
                short years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even after a career working in software development, starting a new endeavor such as this is never easy. I'm trying to get a headstart and begin to prove myself as a web developer. It seems the best way to do that is to get this site and some sample workpieces out
                in front of the public. To help you get acquainted with what I have to offer, in addition to some pretty sweet introductory prices, I'm also offering limited free website development for non-profits and other public service groups. Please
                take the time to click on "<em><a href="pages/wartree.html">Wartree</a></em>" in the menu bar to find out more about how this site is constructed, see examples of other work, and find out about some inexpensive, or even
                free, introductory pricing. For more information about my professional background and qualifications click on "<em><a href="pages/resume.html">Resume</a></em>" in the menu bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other areas of the site are intended mostly for my use as a quick reference for things I get tired of looking up, but I thought I'd incorporate them into the showcase theme of the site, as well as hoping they can be of use to students and others interested
                in the same topics. Feel free to look around and make whatever use you can of anything that interests you.
            </p>

            <br> Among it's more customary uses, this site is also my experimental playground. As such, it should be considered to be always "Under Construction" and subject to outage, inexplicable deadends, odd behavior, visual irregularities, poor design,
            and whatever else I might do to screw it up.
            <br>
            <br> In such an event, don't bother contacting me about them. I already know and will fix things as soon as I get the time and/or inclination.
