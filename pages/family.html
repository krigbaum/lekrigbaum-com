				Hi, guys!  I've reserved this section of the site for whatever family kind of stuff we come up with. I know you were reading carefully and noticed how I said "we".   We have a pretty extended family anymore and I want this section of the site to include everyone.  If you have suggestions for things you want to see on here, just let me know.  I'll be happy to do what I can in implementing them, but I'm counting on you for the content.  I'm also planning on having a separate photo gallery that any of you can upload to so we can all share your photos.I'm also thinking about a family calendar for bitrthday, anniverseries, and other events.  If anyone would like to have a sub-page dedicated to any particular person or whatever, that can also be set up.  In short, I'll do what I can, but I'll need your help in getting everything put together.
				</p>
				<p>
				Also, as you already know or you wouldn't be reading this, I've elected to password-protect this area of the site.  It's really an excess of caution, but there's no point inviting a bunch of strangers in.  Remember, though, that web security is never a certainty, and the password we're using is obviously far from unbreakable.
				</p>
				<p>
				That's enough for now.  I hope you find this worthwhile to check back in on once in a while, and hopefully, to activly participate and contribute to.
				</p>
				<p>
				Whoops... before you go I just wanted to mention the logo for the site.  One of the possible meanings of the name Krigbaum is war tree.  It's not necessarily the right one, but it's the one I prefer and have adopted.
