                    My approach to web development is somewhat minimilist.  I use vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the biggest part of the development process.  Framewoks add weight to a project, and I'm very cautious about using them unless they add specific value.  JQuery is one I may use on occasion for sites that use a lot of dynanmic content, and Bootstrap can also be useful.

                    The most important thing to remember is that this is your website! You need to be satisfied that it is what you want and that it fits your needs, and fulfills your reasons for creating it.  My job is simply to take your vision and make it reality. That being said, I'm not shy about making suggestions, but I don't invest my ego in them and it doesn't hurt my feelings when  you decide against them.

                    Some organizations like to use web designers who provide creative and artistic direction  to the site.  If you feel you lack those skills, you may want to think about bringing a designer on board.  I do NOT consider myself a professional level designer. What's the difference.  The designer is the artistic force behind a website.  I don't feel that I lack good taste and I do have the requisite knowledge of design to avoid obvious pitfalls, but
