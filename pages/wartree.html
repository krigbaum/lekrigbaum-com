                Okay... so as I've already mentioned Wartree Web Development is my post-retirement project to keep me occupied and maybe bring in a few extra dollars. After a lifetime as an IT professional, I can't imagine not being actively involved with software development
                in some way, and it would be nice to have an activity I enjoy. Since I discovered programming back around 1978, it has been my occupation, preoccupation, and hobby. My career in IT has taken me down a few different paths but programming
                is where I keep ending up.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been a software developer for over 20 years now, and my programming has spanned a range of languages includind FORTRAN, COBOL, BASIC, Pascal, C, C++, PHP, Assembly Language (for the PDP 11 and 8086), and probably a few others that slip my mind
                right now. One of my latest languages is Go which I'm still exploring but quite excited about. I'm liking it a lot and have contributed to an open source project developing a driver for the CEPH file system.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had done various web projects over the years, but was never very impressed by the technology. It didn't seen like "real" programming. A couple of years ago I read a few articles about HTML5 and was intrigued enough to take another look. Wow! Not only
                was HTML5 an enormous step forward, but CSS3 complimented it perfectly. Throw in ECSMA 2015 and it was a true development environment. In my spare time I started doing what I always do with interesting technologies. I played with it, studied,
                and played with it more. Then I got serious about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                While my day job still keeps me too occupied to go at it fulltime, I would be quite happy to do some free web development for Lafayette area non-profits as a way to start building a portfolio. If you would be interested in talking to me about what I can
                offer, please check out my <em><a href="resume.html">resume</a></em> and
